## Domain Background
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. It will be good if we detect and prevent this deadly disease in time, it will bring happiness to the sick and have more time to live.

## Problem Statement
Currently, classification methods using machine learning and deep learning have become popular to assist doctors in diagnosing stroke and providing timely treatment. Here, we use two models of machine learning to predict stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. The challenge of working with imbalanced datasets is that most machine learning techniques will ignore, and in turn have poor performance on, the minority class, although typically it is performance on the minority class that is most important.

## Dataset
The data collect from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

## Solution Statement
We use 6 models of Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, lightGBM, xgboost, Adaboost, Random Forest and Decision Tree) and compare them with each other. 

The output expected: Logistic Regreesion has area under curve (82%) higher than each other. 

## Install 
Create virtual environment
```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.7
conda activate myenv
```

Change directory:
```bash
cd stroke-prediction/
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download and set up data by running
```bash
./setup-data.sh
```
or 
```bash
bash ./setup-data.sh
```
Wait about 30 seconds to download data

## Usage
Run terminal and save models
```bash
python train.py
```

Use streamlit to predict stroke
```bash
streamlit run streamlit.py
```
